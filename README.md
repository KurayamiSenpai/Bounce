A paddle and ball game in the vein on Atari's Pong.
Two dogs are trying to hit the ball back and forth without the ball going past them.
If the ball does go past them, that is a point for the other dog. The dog with the
highest score when the player(s) stop, wins.

This game is designed to be able to play with two players. One player uses the Up and Down buttons,
while the other Player uses the A and B buttons. This game is made to run on the Arduboy.

The max score value is 255, if a player plays long enough to reach the max value, then score resets to 0, and player
adds new score to 255 to determine final score.
